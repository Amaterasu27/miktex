<para>If you have never used &TeX; before, then it is recommendable

to work through one of the &TeX;/&LaTeX; tutorials. A good
starting point is this entry in the UK &TeX; &FAQ;:

<para>&MiKTeX; doesn't differ very much from
any other &TeX; system you might have used before.
Typesetting with &MiKTeX; involves these steps:</para>
<procedure>
<step><para>Edit the &LaTeX; source with your
favourite text document editor.</para></step>
<step><para>Compile the &LaTeX; source into a &DVI; file,
i.e., say something like
<userinput>latex MyMastersThesis</userinput>.</para></step>
<step><para>Open the result by double-clicking the &DVI;
file (e.g., <filename>MyMastersThesis.dvi</filename>) in
Windows Explorer.</para></step>
</procedure>

<para>You usually use a &LaTeX; editor to carry out these
steps. The most prominent ones are listed here:
