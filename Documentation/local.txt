This is the

Local Guide to LaTeX for MiKTeX Users
=====================================

MiKTeX doesn't differ very much from any other TeX system you might
have used before.  Typesetting with MiKTeX involves these steps:

1. Edit the LaTeX source with your favourite text document editor.

2. Compile the LaTeX source into a DVI file, i.e., open a
   command-prompt window and enter something like

     latex MyMastersThesis

3. Open the result by double-clicking the DVI file (e.g.,
   MyMastersThesis.dvi) in Windows Explorer.

Please consult the MiKTeX manual for more information.  You should find
a shortcut to the manual in the Windows start menu. If not, visit the
MiKTeX project page (http://miktex.org) to read it on-line.

Thank you for using MiKTeX,
