1. Overview
===========
This package (bmeps) contains a library and a command line
tool to convert bitmap images to EPS.

Bmeps is free software covered by a BSD-style license.
(bsdlic.txt), _except_ the following files
and directories:
- dvips-mods subdirectory
  The files in the dvips-mods subdirectory are derived from the dvips
  sources found in the teTeX distribution. They remain under the original
  copyright and license conditions. The current stable version of dvips
  can be found in the tetex-src.tar.gz archive in the
  ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/unix/teTeX/current/distrib directory.
  After unpacking the archive you will find a tetex-src-2.0.2/texk/dvipsk
  directory (the version name may vary). See the sources and docu in this
  directory for copyright and license details.
- contrib/kant_krishna subdirectory and DOCU/kant_krishna/excel_to_vbs.txt file
  The file excel_to_eps.vb was provided by Krishna Kant. No copyright
  and/or license terms were specified for this file.



2. Installation
===============

2.1 Installation on Unix/Linux
------------------------------

2.1.1 Required libraries
The following libraries are needed to build bmeps
- zlib    (required)
  http://www.gzip.org/zlib
- libpng  (required)
  http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
- jpeglib (recommended)
  ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/jpeg/jpegsrc.v6b.tar.gz
- NetPBM  (recommended)
  ftp://ftp.metalab.unc.edu/pub/Linux/apps/graphics/convert/netpbm-10.11.10.tgz
Note 1: If you use package management software to install these libraries
make sure the developer support (C header files...) is installed too.
Some package managers use separated packages (xxx-dev) to provide
developer support for libraries.
Note 2: On some systems compiler and linker are not properly configured
to use the directories for additional software (i.e. "/usr/local" on
*x systems or "/sw" on Mac OS). In this case you need to set the environment
variables CFLAGS and LDFLAGS, i.e.

on *x systems:                    on Mac OS:
CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include"     CFLAGS="-I/sw/include"
export CFLAGS                     export CFLAGS
LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/lib"        LDFLAGS="-L/sw/lib"
export LDFLAGS                    export LDFLAGS


2.1.2 Installation procedure
The typical
  ./configure
  make
  make install
procedure should do.

2.2 Installation on Windows

WIN32BIN/static directory. Copy bmeps.exe into a directory
