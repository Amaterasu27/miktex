
This package (bmeps) contains a library and a command line
tool to convert bitmap images to EPS.

Bmeps is free software covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License
(see the file COPYING for details), _except_ the files in the
dvips-mods subdirectory.
The files in the dvips-mods subdirectory are derived from the dvips
sources found in the teTeX distribution. They remain under the original
copyright and license conditions. The current stable version of dvips
can be found in the tetex-src.tar.gz archive in the
ftp://ftp.dante.de/tex-archive/systems/unix/teTeX/current/distrib directory.
After unpacking the archive you will find a tetex-src-2.0.2/texk/dvipsk
directory (the version name may vary). See the sources and docu in this
directory for copyright and license details.

For installation and usage instructions see the files in the
DOCU subdirectory.

You can contact me using the contact form
http://www.fh-schmalkalden.de/url.php?/page/1026/select_wert/3023 on
our faculty's web server.
Please use "bmeps bug" or "bmeps suggestion" in the subject.

The bugtracking and feature mechanisms on the SourceForge
web site http://sourceforge.net/projects/bmeps can also be used,
I check them approximately once per month.
