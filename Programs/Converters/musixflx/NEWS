Musixflx implements the second pass of a three-pass system described in
Section 1.3 of the MusiXTeX manual.

Version (0.83.2) incorporates a number of small improvements by Peter
Breitenlohner and the introduction of MUSIXFLXVERSION to distinguish
between "local" changes and changes that affect MusiXTeX; see the
ChangeLog.

Ross Mitchell has by e-mail authorized distribution of this version. 

J. Hunsberger (jhunsberger@i2k.com) claims to be the "jh" who adapted
musixflx to deal with \xbar signature changes and \linegoal in 1997.
He was added as an author in version 0.83.3.
