>, <2 missing substitution warnings:
Missing character: There is no substitution for ^^e0 in font cmr10!
Missing character: There is no substitution for ^^e0 in font cmr10!
>, done.
Test dvi output with substitutions:
<Alternating 5 incomplete subst. + 5 missing subst. warnings: [0

To complete the test:
=====================

1. Compare the log file with the one provided.
2. Compare the dvi output:
The dvi file should contain 5 lines of text, each line beginning
with an ASCII description of the accented character, a colon
followed by five en-dashes and two accented characters:
  a-grave: -- \`a -- \`a-- -- --
  a-acute: -- \'a -- \'a-- -- --
  a-circonflex: -- \^a -- \^a-- -- --
  a-umlaut: -- \"a -- \"a-- -- --
  c-cedille: -- \c{c} -- \c{c}-- -- --
The spacing between the first accented character and the first
two en-dashes has to be correct, whereas the en-dash after the
second accented character has to touch the character! Otherwise
your MLTeX implementation is incorrect.
