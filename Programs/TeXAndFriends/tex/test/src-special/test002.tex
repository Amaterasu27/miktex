\section{Problemreport}
Today I installed the update 3 for Mik\TeX\ 1.11, mainly 
because Pdf\TeX\ didn't work anymore after the last update. 
Of course I also was impressed by the automatic inclusion
of source specials. But not for long. After changing my 
\LaTeX\ calls into \mbox{\texttt{latex --src-specials 
mydoc}} it shows a different behaviour with
paragraphs!

\paragraph{Look here,} this line is indented if compiled 
with src-specials, which it shouldn't. It is not without! 
Some text follows, to make the paragraph a little longer.
Just ignore it.
