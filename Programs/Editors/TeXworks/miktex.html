    <h1>TeXworks for MiKTeX</h1>



    <p>
      The MiKTeX distribution now includes TeXworks, a simple environment for editing 
      TeX/LaTeX documents written by Jonathan Kew.</p>
    <p>
      The MiKTeX version has the following features:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>By default, the MiKTeX compiler driver (texify) is used to typeset LaTeX 
        documents.</li>
      <li>Some spelling dictionaries (*.dict) are included in the standard MiKTeX 
        distribution.</li>
      <li>TeX/LaTeX related file name extensions (*.tex, *.sty, *.pdf, ...) are 
        associated with TeXworks.</li>
      <li>An extra About dialog has been added to the Help menu.</li>
      <li>When sending a message to the TeXworks mailing list (Help-&gt;Email to the 
        mailing list), the subject contains the word MiKTeX.</li>
      <li>The MiKTeX bin directory is automatically added to the program path 
        (Edit-&gt;Preferences...-&gt;Typesetting).</li>
    </ul>
