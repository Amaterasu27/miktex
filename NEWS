 * MiKTeX-pdfTeX, the MiKTeX variant of the pdfTeX angine, has been
   ported to UNIX system-like platforms.

   The engine features integrated package management: missing packages
   will be installed on-the-fly (after confirmation).

   The binary is installed as miktex-pdftex so that it can coexist
   with the system-installed pdftex binary.

 * Run-time configuration: the MiKTeX configuration utility uses
   kpsewhich(1) to find existing TEXMF trees.

 * Link everything statically (don't build shared objects).

 * Binary packages (.rpm/.deb/.tgz) are now available for GNU/Linux
   systems.  See http://miktex.org/unx/ for more information.

 Restrictions:

 * Only per-user configuration is supported at the momement (all
   configuration settings are stored under $HOME/.miktex).

 * Packages will be installed for the current user only.  A better
   approach would be to install packages in the /usr/ hierarchy.  In
   order to get there, the package manager has to be implemented as a
   daemon.  This is on the TODO list.
