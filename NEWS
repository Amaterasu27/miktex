 * MiKTeX-pdfTeX, the MiKTeX variant of the pdfTeX angine, has been
   ported to UNIX system-like platforms.

   The engine features integrated package management: missing packages
   will be installed on-the-fly (after confirmation).

   The binary is installed as miktex-pdftex so that it can coexist
   with the system-installed pdftex binary.

 * Binary packages (.rpm/.deb/.tgz) are now available for i386
   GNU/Linux systems.  See http://miktex.org/unx/ for more
   information.

 * Link everything statically (don't build shared objects).

 * The MiKTeX package manager graphical user interface (GUI) has been
   ported to UNIX system-like platforms using the Qt widget toolkit.
